                <h2>3. SankalpTaru Services Description</h2>
                <p>
                SankalpTaru Foundation is an NGO registered under The Societies Registration Act, 1860. It aims to create greenery on Earth with the contribution from corporate organizations, their employees, individuals, environmental agencies and funding entities. ST gives its users an opportunity to select a site from listed options to plant trees. We use internet and associated information technology enabled processes to ensure transparency and visibility. We issue a certificate as a token of appreciation to planters and also post the same on social networks if the user opts for the same.
                <br/><br/>
                In lieu of our services following points should be noted:
                <br/><br/>
                ST runs the tree plantation and rural livelihood program across India. We follow a strict due diligence process to select sites for plantation and Program Beneficiaries.
                <br/><br/>
                ST and its affiliates adopts best practices to plant trees and make best efforts to maintain trees post plantation. However, ST shall not be responsible for any harm to planted trees which may occur due to reasons beyond our control (fire, flood, earthquake, drought, diseases and land acquisition by government authorities). We ensure planted trees are intact and safe, however ST shall not be responsible for the harm occurring from illegal felling or grazing of trees.
                <br/><br/>
                Sometimes it may be possible that we may tag already planted tree to your virtual tree. This is done only under exceptional circumstances. We maintain a separate lot to meet the aforementioned eventuality. However, ST NEVER tags trees which have already been tagged to other planters.
                <br/><br/>
                Wherever contributors/planters are interested to visit plantation sites they are encouraged to do so on their own expenses.
                <br/><br/>
                Planters do not own trees or any products derived from the trees planted by them.
                <br/><br/>
                We as an NGO shall be under no liability whatsoever in respect of any loss or damage arising directly or indirectly out of the decline of authorization for any Transaction, on Account of the Cardholder having exceeded the preset limit mutually agreed by us with our acquiring bank from time to time.
